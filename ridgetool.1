.SH NAME
ridgetool - Image ridge detection
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ridgetool
[\fIOPTION\fR ...] \fIIMAGE_FILE\fR [\fIRDG_FILE\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP

\fBridgetool\fR is a tool for extracting bright curvilinear features
from images using scale-space ridge detection.  It takes a TIFF image
as input, and generates a ridge data file as output. The tool can
extract individual ridge points, two-point linear ridge segments, or
full ridge lines.  It is highly scalable to large input images, and
can efficiently use multiple processors.  It is based on a
single-scale variant of the Lindeberg scale-space detector described
in [LINDEBERG1998].

The input file \fIIMAGE_FILE\fR must be a single-channel TIFF image in
32-bit floating point format.  If an output file \fIRDG_FILE\fR is
specified, \fBridgetool\fR will populate it with ridge data in the
ridge data file format.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 8
\fB-s\fR, \fB--segments\fR
Extract ridge segments. This is the default extraction mode.  It
extracts ridge data as pairs of adjacent ridge points.
.TP 8
\fB-l\fR, \fB--lines\fR
Extract ridge lines. In this mode, full ridge lines are extracted as
curvilinear features composed of a series of ridge points.
.TP 8
\fB-p\fR, \fB--points\fR
Extract individual ridge points.
.TP 8
\fB-t\fR, \fB--scales\fR=\fISCALE\fR[:\fISCALE2\fR ...]
Specify a single \fISCALE\fR or a set of scales to be used for
scale-space generation.  If multiple scales are specified, only the
first is currently chosen.  If no scale was specified, no scale-space
is generated, and ridges are extracted directly from the input image.
.TP 8
\fB-m\fR, \fB--metric\fR=[\fBN\fR | \fBA\fR | \fBM\fR]
Set the ridge strength metric to be used. The three metrics (\fBA\fR, \fBN\fR and
\fBM\fR) are described more fully in [LINDEBERG1998].  By default, the
\fBN\fR metric is used.
.TP 8
\fB-j\fR, \fB--threads\fR=\fINUM\fR
Set the number of parallel threads to use.  Usually, \fINUM\fR should
be set to the number of available processors.  By default, only a
single thread is used.
.TP 8
\fB-i\fR, \fB--nan\fR=\fIVAL\fR
Replace bad pixel values with \fIVAL\fR. Because some remote sensing
image products contain non-finite or NaN pixel values, \fBridgetool\fR
will replace these with a finite value before scale-space generation.
By default, the replacement value is 0.
.TP 8
\fB-h\fR, \fB--help\fR
Print a help message.

.SH DEBUGGING OPTIONS
.TP 8
\fB-v\fR, \fB--verbose\fR
Enable output of debugging messages.
.TP 8
\fB--dump-L\fR=\fIFILE\fR
Export the scale-space representation to \fIFILE\fR as a
single-channel 32-bit floating point TIFF image.
.TP 8
\fB--dump-Lp\fR=\fIFILE\fR
Export the Lp metric to \fIFILE\fR as a single-channel 32-bit floating
point TIFF image.
.TP 8
\fB--dump-Lpp\fR=\fIFILE\fR
Export the Lpp metric to \fIFILE\fR as a single-channel 32-bit
floating point TIFF image.
.TP 8
\fB--dump-R\fR=\fIFILE\fR
Dump the ridge strength metric to \fIFILE\fR as a single-channel
32-bit floating point TIFF image.
