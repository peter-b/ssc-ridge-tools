 Surrey Space Centre ridge tools for SAR data processing

To-do list
==========

- Windows support.  Will require use of multithreading instead of
  multiprocessing. Changes will need to be made in
  ridgeutil_multiproc.c and in any programs which use
  rut_multiproc_task().

- Multi-scale ridge detection.  Most of the required capabilities are
  already present, including three-dimensional image spaces and
  filtering along the scale dimension.  Supporting large images will
  require some sort of support for automatically subdividing and
  recombining images, due to the much higher memory requirements.
  Changes will be required throughout, including upgrades to ridge
  file format to incorporate scale data.

- Support in the tools for multiclass classification.  Mostly all
  that's required is support in the tool frontends; the file format
  uses a byte for each element's classification data, and so to all of
  the tools, so support for up to 256 classes is pretty much there
  already.

- ridgeconv doesn't understand classification metadata. To improve
  visualisation of classified ridge data, it would be useful to add
  support for optionally colouring the graphical formats by class.
