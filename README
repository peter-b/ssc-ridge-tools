 Surrey Space Centre ridge tools for SAR data processing

Introduction
============

This package provides several tools for working with curvilinear
features extracted from images using ridge detection, as part of
research into detection of earthquake damage in urban areas.  It was
developed at Surrey Space Centre at the University of Surrey in
Guildford, UK.

The curvilinear feature detector used is a single-scale variant of the
Lindeberg scale-space ridge detector.

Programs and librarys
=====================

All tools in the 'ssc-ridge-tools' package support an '-h' option to
display usage information.

 - 'ridgetool' detects ridges in a single-channel 32-bit floating
   point TIFF file, and can extract either ridge points, segments or
   full curvilinear features.

 - 'ridgeconv' converts ridge data to other formats, and supports CSV,
   PNG, TIFF, PDF, and SVG output.

 - 'ridgecull' removes ridges from a ridge data file, based on
   threshold values of brightness, length or ridge strength.

 - 'xridgeclass' is a graphical tool for manual 2-class classification
   of ridge data.

 - 'ridgeclassexport' exports classified ridge data into per-class
   data files.

The 'libridgetool' library provides two APIs:

 - loading and saving ridge data to an efficient binary file format;
 - surface and scale space data types that support multiprocessing.

For more information, see the 'ridgeutil.h' and 'ridgeio.h' header files.

Installation
============

The 'ssc-ridge-tools' package can currently only be compiled on:

 - 32-bit architectures that support atomic compare-and-swap
   operations (e.g. recent x86 systems)
 - 64-bit architectures that support the 'CMPXCHG16B' processor
   instruction.

It also requires the 'mmap()' system call to support the 'MAP_SHARED'
and 'MAP_ANONYMOUS' flags.  Most recent versions of Linux provide
this.

Dependencies
------------

In order to compile and install the 'ssc-ridge-tools' package, you must
have the following tools and libraries installed:

 - A C compiler and standard library (GCC/glibc are recommended).

 - The `pkg-config' tool for managing shared libraries.
   <http://pkgconfig.freedesktop.org/>

 - GTK+ (the Gimp Toolkit), version  2.10.0 or later.
   <http://www.gtk.org/>

 - Cairo vector graphics library, version 1.8.0 or later, with PNG,
   PDF and SVG support available.
   <http://www.cairographics.org/>

 - GSL (the GNU Scientific Library), version 1.13 or later.
   <http://wwww.gnu.org/s/gsl/>

 - LibTIFF.
   <http://www.libtiff.org/>

If you are compiling from the 'ssc-ridge-tools' git repository, you
will also require:

  - The `git' version control tool, version 1.6 or newer.
    <http://git-scm.com/>

  - GNU Automake, version 1.11.0 or newer.
    <http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/>

  - GNU Autoconf, version 2.60 or newer.
    <http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/>

  - GNU Libtool.  <http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/>

Configuration and compilation
-----------------------------

If you are building from git, clone the repository and set up the
source tree:

  git clone git://github.com/peter-b/ssc-ridge-tools.git
  cd ssc-ridge-tools
  ./autogen.sh

Otherwise, extract the source files.

You can then proceed to configure, compile and install the tools in
the usual manner:

  ./configure
  make
  make install

For a full list of the options that can be passed to 'configure',
please see:

  ./configure --help
